For those who like to read ahead, in this class I will continue with the slides I didn't get to on Wednesday and I will continue with the important basic "discrete" random variables. I may get to properties and examples of "continuous" random variables. 

I have in some sense reconverged with the textbook material, although I will continue to emphasize the notion of "distribution" that the book doesn't mention.
